# Test-3-Backend - Terraform State Deep Dive

## Problems with Local State Files

### Scenario 1: Security Risk
- **Problem:** If GitHub is compromised and state files are stored in version control
- **Risk:** Anyone can access sensitive infrastructure details and credentials
- **Impact:** Complete infrastructure exposure

### Scenario 2: State Mismatch
- **Problem:** Team member pulls code, makes changes (like adding tags), applies without latest state file
- **Risk:** Next user gets errors due to mismatch between Terraform files and actual state
- **Impact:** Infrastructure drift and deployment failures

## Solution: Remote Backend

### Implementation
- Use **S3 bucket** as remote backend
- Terraform saves state file in S3 after each apply
- Always compares both repository code and S3 state
- **Alternative options:** Terraform Cloud, Azure Storage

### Team Workflow Example
**Scenario:** DevOps team of 4-5 people creating VPC with 3-tier architecture

1. Use S3 bucket to store state files
2. Make infrastructure changes and apply
3. State file automatically stored in S3 as backend
4. Code merged only after pull request approval
5. All team members work with same state reference

## State Locking with DynamoDB

### Why Locking?
- Prevents multiple people from running Terraform commands simultaneously
- Avoids state file corruption and conflicts
- Ensures infrastructure consistency

### Implementation
- Create DynamoDB table for lock management
- Configure in backend configuration
- Lock ID stored in DynamoDB during operations
- Automatic lock release after command completion
